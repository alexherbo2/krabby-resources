Hello and welcome to this introduction to Krabby.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
Krabby is a Kakoune-inspired browser extension using a selection-driven browsing method.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.500
I will try to give you a first look at how it works, assuming basic vi knowledge.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
As in vi, you can move around using the home row keys — <u>j</u>, <u>k</u>,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
follow a link with <u>f</u>,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
yank a page with <u>y</u>.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.500
Notice at the right-bottom of the page the context in which commands are executed.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500
When you focus a page document,

00:33.500 --> 00:37.000
select a link,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
click a text input,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
a video…

00:42.500 --> 00:45.500
For example, <u>y</u> will yank the page address,

00:45.500 --> 00:50.500
but if I select a link, it will yank the link address.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
As you can see, Krabby reverses the vi bindings (action, object) to (selection, action),

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
and it gives us two advantages:

01:00.500 --> 01:04.000
First, we can directly see if the selection is not what we wanted.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.000
Secondly, we have access to a much more expressive selection language.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Another particular feature of Krabby is its support for, and emphasis towards, the use of multiple selections.

01:18.500 --> 01:24.500
One way to get multi-selection is with the <u>s</u> command to create a selection out of the active element,

01:24.500 --> 01:28.000
<u>Alt + a</u> to expand the region,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.500
followed by <u>Alt + I</u> to select the links.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Once you are done with your multiple selections,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
the <u>Space</u> command allows you to discard them and keep only the active element.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500
Lets take a look at a few examples.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
As you can see, multiple selections provide us with a very expressive and concise way of accessing web content.

03:44.500 --> 03:49.500
Besides selections, Krabby provides some other nice features.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.500
That’s it for this introduction to Krabby,

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
I hope you enjoyed it.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.000
